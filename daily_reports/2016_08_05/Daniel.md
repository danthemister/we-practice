Hey Jane,

It seems this is the first letter I would send to you.

I'm so glad to see that you started to upload your daily updates, by your own motivation rather than my instructions. It somehow inspired me, indeed.

First thing first, I would suggest you to get started with `Markdown` in writing daily updates (it's a powerful document type for devs, see the suffix `.md` of my report). There are lots of convenient usages of Markdown which help you to better structure/format your documents. 

Check this out: [Markdown wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). There're also quite a lot of powerful Markdown editors, I'll leave it to you to figure out your favourite one on the internet (but to be honest, normally a system default TextEditor/Notepad is enough).	



**I would strongly suggest you to log your everyday status in following format, which is better for reading:**
