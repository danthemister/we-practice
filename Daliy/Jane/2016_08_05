Hello Dan.
Are you working now .
I just figured out  how to create a folder.
If you feel tired ,just hava a break.
And I am always here.
__18:04
I think my work efficiency is very low .
I don't like it 
I have ever said If I do things over three days there is no meaning to do it anymore .
It seems that recently It is .
so I need to do something to have a change
__1.Make daily plans and to Finish it .
__2.To learn things everday for two hours  no matter what 
__3.To learn english everyday for half and hour everymorning .
these are the things that recently i want to do .
And i know it will change me a lot if i stick at it .
